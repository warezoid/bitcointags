# Bitcointags
Bitcointags is a browser extension that converts the fiat price of a product or service within a selected HTML entity into an approximate Bitcoin price.

## Alert!
The price returned by Bitcointags is indicative only. The exchange rate is constantly changing and bitcoin does not have a uniform price. Therefore, the price may vary when the e-shop is billed!

## Coming soon...
- Adding the first version of Bitcointags to the Chrome Web Store.
- Clear README file and extensive documentation.
- Firefox version.
- Select&convert mode.
- It tells you whether the e-shop accepts bitcoins.
