# Bitcointags documentation



## Abstract
This document provides a detailed technical description of the Bitcointags project code. It is intended for developers who wish to contribute to the development of this project. The document contains an in-depth analysis of the code structure, the technologies used, and the implemented functions. The documentation primarily focuses on the [script.js](../src/script.js) file, which is the core of the Bitcointags project. For information regarding usage guides, frequently asked questions (FAQ), and similar topics, please refer to the [README.md](../README.md) file.
